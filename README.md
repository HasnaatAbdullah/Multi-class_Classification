# Multi-class Classification

In this project, I worked on **multi-class classification** using a real-world dataset.  
I implemented **Logistic Regression** and applied two different strategies: **One-vs-All (OvA)** and **One-vs-One (OvO)**.  
I also used **one-hot encoding** for categorical variables and evaluated the model performance using suitable metrics.

## **Objectives**

After completing this project, I was able to:

- Understand and implement **one-hot encoding** for categorical variables.
- Use **Logistic Regression** for multi-class classification.
- Apply **One-vs-All (OvA)** and **One-vs-One (OvO)** classification strategies.
- Evaluate the model performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

## **Project Overview**

Multi-class classification is used when we need to classify data into **more than two categories**.  
In this project, I followed these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables using **One-hot encoding**
   - Scaled numerical features where necessary

2. **Model Training**
   - Used **Logistic Regression** for classification
   - Applied both **OvA** and **OvO** strategies

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compared model performance for OvA and OvO
   - Evaluated using metrics:
     - **Accuracy**
     - **Precision**
     - **Recall**
     - **F1-score**
   - Used a **confusion matrix** to analyze predictions
